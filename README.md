iv.Set Up a Virtual Environment:
-Navigate to your project directory using cd path/to/your/project.
-Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv.
-Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate.

        INSTALLING ON LINUX.
i.Check if Python is Already Installed:
Open Terminal and run: python3 --version or python --version.
ii.Install Python (if not installed):
*For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
bash
"sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip"

*For Fedora:
bash
"sudo dnf install python3
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip"
iii.Verify Installation:
Run: python3 --version or python --version.
iv.Set Up a Virtual Environment:
-Navigate to your project directory using cd path/to/your/project.
-Create a virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv.
-Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate.


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

    SYNTAX ELEMENTS.
a.print() Function:
This is a built-in function in Python used to output data to the console. In this case, it displays the string provided as an argument.
b.String:
The text "Hello, World!" is a string, which is enclosed in double quotes ("). In Python, strings can also be enclosed in single quotes (').
c.Parentheses ():
Parentheses are used to call the function. In this case, they enclose the argument that the 'priint()' funtion takes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

a.Integer (int): Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
Example: 42, -10
b.Float (float): Represents numbers that have a decimal point, allowing for fractional values.
Example: 3.14, -0.001
c.String (str): Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes.
Example: "Hello, World!", 'Python'
d.Boolean (bool): Represents one of two values: True or False. Useful for conditional statements.
Example: True, False
e.List (list): An ordered collection of items that can hold mixed data types, enclosed in square brackets.
Example: [1, 2, 3, "apple"]
f.Tuple (tuple): An ordered, immutable collection of items, enclosed in parentheses.
Example: (1, 2, 3, "apple")
g.Dictionary (dict): An unordered collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces.
Example: {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
Conditional statements-Allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions
Loops-Allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Fuctions-Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

          WHY FUNSTIONS ARE USEFUL.
 *Reusability: Write code once and use it multiple times.
 *Modularity: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
 *Maintainability: Easier to update and maintain code when itâ€™s organized into functions.
 *Clarity: Improves the readability of code by using descriptive function names.


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

         DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LISTS AND DICTIONAIES.
      i.Lists can contain duplicate values while dictionaries must be unique.
      ii.List are enlosed in square brackets while dictioanries are enclosed in curly braces.
      iii.List are ordered collection of items while dictionaries are unordered collection of items.
      iv.Lists are acces by index while dictionaries are accessed bykeys.


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
  *Exception handling in Python allows you to manage errors and exceptional conditions gracefully without crashing the program. It uses try, except, and finally blocks to catch and handle exceptions.

         KEY COMPONENTS
      i.Try block- Contains code that may raise an exception.
      ii.Except block- Contains code that executes if an exception occurs in the try block.
      iii.finally block- Contains code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup actions.

   

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
          *Modules are simply Python files (.py) that contain definitions of functions, classes, and variables. They help organize your code and promote reuse. You can create your own modules or use built-in ones.

          *Packages are collections of modules organized in directories. A package must contain a special __init__.py file (which can be empty) to indicate that the directory should be treated as a package. 



10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
      * Read ('r'): Opens a file for reading (default).
      *Write ('w'): Opens a file for writing, truncating the file if it already exists.
